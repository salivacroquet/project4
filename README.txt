How to compile and run your program:
The program can compile and run in the terminal or through inteliJ. 

Any assumptions:
-Note that we DO NOT allow the player to remove flags, once they have flagged a space it
 will stay flagged for the entire game. So if they flag something that is not a mine they automatically lose

Any known bugs or defects in the program:
None that we know of.

Additional features that you implemented (if applicable):
Not Applicable.

Any outside sources (aside from course resources) consulted for ideas used in the project:
-None

I certify that the information contained in this README
file is complete and accurate. I have both read and followed the course policies
in the ‘Academic Integrity - Course Policy’ section of the course syllabus.
